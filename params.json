The main site script is run on a cron job. The pdf collection script is run when new pdfs are added.\r\n\r\nThe collection can be found [here](http://freedaleaskey.plggta.org/).\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert here. If you know of a better way to do it, please contribute! It can even be something as simple as adding sites to the site text file.\r\n\r\n1.
